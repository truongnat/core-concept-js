# Primary Types.

  * Concept: Javascript is a loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables in Javascript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned ( and re-assigned ) values of all types. The set of types in the Javascript language consists of `primitive values` and `objects`.
    - `Primitive types`: immutable datum represented directly at the lowest level of the language.
      + `Boolean type`.
      + `Null type`.
      + `Undefined type`.
      + `Number type`.
      + `BigInt type`.
      + `String type`.
      + `Symbol type`.
    - `Objects` ( collection of properties ).
